                                    Multicultural students often possess a heightened ability to read a room. They often need to translate emotions and intentions across different cultural contexts, allowing them to empathize with diverse groups of people. This makes multicultural students an exceptional leader, teammate and communicator. 
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    While monocultural students may struggle with culture shock or international etiquette, multicultural students are able to adapt quickly to new environments. In a professional world that is more interconnected than ever, that background is a massive competitive advantage. 
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    As multicultural students constantly navigate different cultural norms, languages, and social cues, their brains are always practicing cognitive flexibility. Thus, they are naturally better at thinking outside the box, and see multiple paths to solve problems based on different cultural frameworks. 
                                </p>

                                <p>Many multicultural students face the feeling of not being enough or not fully being a part of either side of their heritage. They may feel like a foreigner in their country of residence, yet also feel like a tourist when they visit their family’s country of origin. 
                                </p>

                                <h4>2. Microaggression</h4>
                                <p>Multicultural students may struggle with bullying that isnt presented in a direct way. They may appear in forms such as mocking accents, jokes about their lunch, and the “Where are you really from" questions. These comments are often disguised as a joke, and multicultural students may feel like they are just too sensitive when they get upset. 
                                </p>
                            </div><!-- second strugle -->

                                <h4>Pressure to Minimize Themselves</h4>
                                <p>Multicultural students may be pressured to hide their culture or hide their “true self”. They may stop speaking their heritage language in public, change their name, or pull away from their family’s traditions just to blend in. Reasons for this often stem from trying to protect themselves from bullies or assimilating to a foreign culture. 
                                </p>

                                <h4>1. Cultural Alienation and Self-rejection</h4>
                                <p>Multicultural students that are constantly bullied may begin to view their own heritage as a problem to be solved. To stop the bullying, they might start to distance themselves from the things that represent their culture. This can lead to internalized bias as they reject their own home language, traditional foods or cultural practices. Additionally, they may feel a sense of shame or embarrassment toward their family, leading to a “split” identity where they feel disconnected from their roots but not fully accepted by the dominant culture. 
                                </p>
                            </div><!-- first struggle -->

                                <h4>2. Social Withdrawal and Depression</h4>
                                <p>Bullying and identity uncertainty are key factors that often lead to social withdrawal. As multicultural students feel they will be judged or misunderstood no matter what they do, they may stop trying to connect with others altogether. This isolation is a major risk factor for depression. They may feel a deep sense of loneliness, believing that no one truly understands them. 
                                </p>
                            </div><!-- second strugle -->

                                <h4>Substance Use and other Coping Mechanisms</h4>
                                <p>When multicultural students face chronic stress from discrimination without healthy support systems, some students may turn to substances like alcohol or drugs to temporarily escape the feelings of anxiety, depression and not belonging. While this may help for a moment, substance use can easily turn into an addiction and make it harder for them to regulate their emotions naturally in the future. 
                                </p>
